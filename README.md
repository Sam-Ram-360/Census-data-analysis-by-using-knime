# Census-data-analytics-by-using-knime

In this project, I followed a specific sequence of steps to analyze the census data of 2011. Firstly, I provided an overview of the basic statistics derived from the dataset. Next, I implemented various classification algorithms to classify the data based on specific attributes. Additionally, I employed regression algorithms to examine the relationship between the "No of hours" attribute and other variables.

To further explore the data, I conducted Association Rule Mining, aiming to discover interesting associations and patterns within the dataset. This analysis provided insights into the relationships between different attributes and their co-occurrence.

Lastly, I performed clustering algorithms, specifically utilizing the K-means algorithm, to group similar data points together based on their characteristics. This approach helped identify patterns and similarities among the individuals in the census dataset.

To reproduce these analyses, you will need the initial census2011 dataset. I have uploaded it as a compressed zip file, which contains all the necessary data to run these algorithms. Please access the repository to download the dataset and utilize it for running the different steps of the project.

If you have any further questions or require additional support, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you.
